# JaCoCo + Payara Micro + Arquillian Example

This project is a **working example** demonstrating how to:

* Build a **Jakarta EE 10** application
* Run it on **Payara Micro**
* Test it using **JUnit 5 + Arquillian**
* Collect **code coverage** using **JaCoCo** for:

  * Unit tests
  * Integration tests running inside Payara Micro
* Generate a **merged coverage report**

The repository is intended as a **reference project** for setting up real-world test coverage when using Payara Micro.

## 🔑 Key Points for Coverage with Payara Micro

When collecting code coverage from **integration tests running inside Payara Micro**, the following points are critical:

* The **JaCoCo Java agent must be attached to the Payara Micro JVM**, not just the Maven test JVM
* This is achieved by adding the `-javaagent` argument to **Payara Micro JVM options** configured via **`arquillian.xml`**
* JaCoCo must be configured in **`tcpserver` mode** so the agent inside Payara Micro can stream execution data
* Because Payara Micro runs in its own JVM, coverage data **cannot be written automatically when tests finish**
* Coverage data is explicitly collected in an **`@AfterAll`** method in the Arquillian integration test by:

  * Connecting to the JaCoCo agent running in the Payara Micro JVM in arquillian.xml (agent jar is copied via build-test-microbundle profile)
    ```xml
    	<property name="cmdOptions">
			-javaagent:target/jacoco/org.jacoco.agent-runtime.jar=output=tcpserver,address=*,port=6300 
	 	</property>
    ```
  * Triggering a dump of execution data in @AfterAll method in BaseTest
    ```java
    	@AfterAll
   		static void captureCoverage() throws IOException {
		    int port = 6300;
		    ExecDumpClient jacocoClient = new ExecDumpClient();
		    ExecFileLoader dump = jacocoClient.dump("localhost", port);
		    dump.save(new File("./target/jacoco/jacoco-payara-it.exec"), true);
	   	}
    ```
  * Writing the data to `jacoco-payara-it.exec`

This approach ensures that **coverage generated inside the application server JVM** is reliably captured and later merged with unit test coverage.

## ⚙️ Maven Configuration Highlights

### Packaging

* The project is packaged as a **WAR**
* A **Payara Micro bundle** is created during the `package` phase

### Code Coverage

* JaCoCo agent is attached to:

  * Unit test JVM
  * Payara Micro JVM (integration tests)
* Execution data is **merged**
* A single HTML report is generated

---

## 🚀 How to Build and Run

### 1️⃣ Build the Project

```bash
 mvn clean package -Pbuild-test-microbundle -DskipTests
```

This will:

* Compile the application
* Create a Payara Micro bundle

---

### 2️⃣ Run Tests with Coverage

Use the provided Maven profile:

```bash
mvn verify -Ptests-with-coverage-report
```

This will:

1. Run unit tests with JaCoCo
2. Start Payara Micro
3. Deploy the application
4. Run Arquillian integration tests
5. Collect JaCoCo data from both JVMs
6. Merge coverage data
7. Generate an HTML report

---

## 📊 Coverage Report

After the build completes, open:

```
target/jacoco/coverage-report/index.html
```

This report contains **merged coverage** from:

* Unit tests
* Integration tests running inside Payara Micro

---

## 🧠 Key Lessons from This Project
* Payara Micro runs in a **separate JVM**, so JaCoCo must use `tcpserver` mode
* JaCoCo execution data must be **merged** manually

---

## ❗ Common Pitfalls

* Missing `junit-jupiter-engine` dependency → tests will not be discovered
* Forgetting to pass JaCoCo agent to Payara JVM → missing coverage
